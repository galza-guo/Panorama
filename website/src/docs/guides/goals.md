# Goals & Limits

Panorama helps you plan for the future with Goals.

## Financial Goals

Set a target value for your portfolio or specific accounts.

- **Target Amount**: How much do you want to reach?
- **Target Date**: When do you want to reach it?
- **Linked Accounts**: Which accounts contribute to this goal?

Panorama will track your progress and project if you are on track to meet your
goal based on your current growth rate.

## Contribution Limits

Track your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs, 401(k)s, ISAs, or
TFSAs.

1.  Set the **Limit Amount** for the year.
2.  Link the relevant account.
3.  Panorama will show you how much room you have left for the year.
