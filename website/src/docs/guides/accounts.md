# Managing Accounts

Accounts represent where your assets are held (e.g., "Chase Bank", "Fidelity",
"Coinbase").

## Creating an Account

1.  Go to **Settings > Accounts**.
2.  Click **Add Account**.
3.  **Name**: Give it a recognizable name.
4.  **Type**:
    - **Security**: For stocks, ETFs, mutual funds.
    - **Cash**: For bank accounts or high-yield savings.
    - **Crypto**: For cryptocurrency wallets or exchanges.
    - **Custom**: For real estate, art, or other assets.
5.  **Currency**: The primary currency for this account.

## Hiding Accounts

You can "Hide" an account if you want to keep its data but remove it from your
main dashboard totals (e.g., for an account you manage for someone else).
