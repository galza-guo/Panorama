# Dashboards

The Dashboard is your main overview in Panorama.

## Sections

- **Total Value**: Your current Net Worth in your base currency.
- **Performance Chart**: A line graph showing your portfolio's value over time.
  You can toggle between different time ranges (1M, YTD, 1Y, ALL).
- **Asset Allocation**: A pie chart showing how your wealth is distributed
  across different assets (Stocks, Cash, Crypto, Real Estate).
- **Top Movers**: A quick look at your best and worst performing assets for the
  day.

## Customization

You can filter the dashboard by specific **Account Groups** (e.g., see only your
"Retirement" accounts) to get a focused view.
