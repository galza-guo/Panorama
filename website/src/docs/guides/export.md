# Export & Backup

Since Panorama is local-first, backing up your data is your responsibility. We
make it easy.

## Backup (SQL)

You can export your entire database as a single file.

- Go to **Settings > Export**.
- Select **Database Backup**.
- Save the file (`panorama-backup.sqlite`) to a secure location.
- **Restore**: You can restore this file on any new installation of Panorama.

## Export (CSV/JSON)

If you want to use your data in Excel or other tools:

- **Transactions CSV**: Exports every single activity.
- **Holdings CSV**: Exports your current portfolio snapshot.
- **JSON**: Exports a structured JSON file of your entire portfolio state.
