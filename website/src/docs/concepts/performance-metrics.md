# Performance Metrics

Panorama uses industry-standard metrics to help you understand your portfolio's
performance.

## Time-Weighted Return (TWR)

TWR measures the compound rate of growth of your portfolio. It eliminates the
distorting effects of inflows and outflows of money. This is the best metric to
compare your performance against a benchmark (like the S&P 500) because it
isolates your investment decisions from your deposit/withdrawal timing.

## Money-Weighted Return (MWR / IRR)

MWR (often called Internal Rate of Return) takes into account the timing and
size of your cash flows. It reflects the actual return you achieved on the money
you had invested. If you timed the market well (buying low, selling high), your
MWR will be higher than your TWR.

## Simple Return

The absolute percentage change in value. \`(Current Value - Cost Basis) / Cost
Basis\`

## Volatility & Max Drawdown

- **Volatility**: Measures how much your portfolio's value fluctuates.
- **Max Drawdown**: The largest percentage drop from a peak to a trough. It
  helps you understand the risk you've taken.
