# Privacy & Security

At Panorama, we believe your financial data belongs to you—and only you.

## Local-First Design

Panorama follows a "Local-First" philosophy. This means:

- **No Cloud Storage**: Your data is never uploaded to our servers (because we
  don't have any!).
- **Local Database**: All your transactions, account details, and settings are
  stored in an encrypted SQLite database on your own computer.
- **You Control Your Data**: You can back up, export, or delete your data at any
  time.

## Data Usage

- **Market Data**: To provide real-time prices, Panorama connects to public
  market data providers (like Yahoo Finance). Queries are made directly from
  your computer to these providers.
- **Updates**: The app checks GitHub periodically to see if a new version is
  available.

We do not track your usage, sell your data, or monetize your financial
information in any way.
